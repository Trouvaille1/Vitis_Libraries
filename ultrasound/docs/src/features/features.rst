Features for Vitis Ultrasound Library 
=====================================

.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1

Vitis Ultrasound library provides implementation of different L1/L2/L3 APIs for ultrasound image processing. For library users, these APIs contains source code for AIE & PL kernels. The testbench is also provided for simulation and verification for each single cases.

Code structures enhancement
----------------------------

- L1: all L1 BLAS apis could be referenced by including "L1/include/", different apis sources files (AIE kernel code) locate in separated directory.
- L2: all L2 ultrasound component apis could be reference by including "L2/include/", different apis shareing golbal settings from "L1/include/kernels.hpp".
- L3, all 3 examples of connected beamformer (PW/SA/Scanline) are located in separated directory under "L3/tests", each include self-contain data and source code.
- Design code structure enahancement: for L2/L3 cases, source code for differenct device are well orgnized. The structure is showed as bellow:

.. code-block:: txt

   aie_graph:     aie graph define
   PL_kernels:    HLS C/C++ code for PL kernels 
   PS_host:       XRT based host code for VCK190
   data:          input data & output golden data
   system.cfg:    hw platform descriptions

Host code enhancement
---------------------

For L2/L3 cases, XRT based PS host code are provided in each directory of "<path_to_apis>/PS_host/". The host code read input simulation data and call on aie graph by 1 run and also evoke PL kernels of "mm2s" and "s2mm" for PL side data input/output. The result are compared to "data/golden" for verify the design.
 
Support for AIE full verification flow on VCK190 platform
-----------------------------------------------------------

This library provides the detailed examples for full aie design/verification flow, which contains x86sim/aiesim/sw_emu(ps_on_x86)/hw_emu/hw. The testbench supports "make run TARGET=*" from basic functional verfication to final hw performance test, and also contain godlen check. Users could check performance or funcional correctness through each of the verification.
