Ultrasound Library - Level 2 (L2)
---------------------------------

As stated in the introduction, the L2 level of the Ultrasound Library is composed of the mathematical components needed for the beamformation of the rf-data. Those components, on the other hand of the L1 APIs, are AIE graphs, and no longer just single kernels.
As introduced in the dedicated section, the AIE graphs are a compositions of AIE kernels presents in L1 library. For these reasons the level of abstraction is increased with respect to the previous level.
It is going now to be detailed every components of the L2 library with a connection to the already explained theory to bind the concepts with their actual implementation.

Graph name: `Image Points`
###########################

The Image Points graph is used to create a matrix which represents the part of investigation made by the specific emission of the Ultrasound Probe. The rows of this matrix have incremental values which represents our values used to compute delay for the **virtual sources**. It is dependent on the investigation depth and the incremental investigation which we want to perform (based on our sampling frquency).

- **Graph Inputs**:
	- `start_positions`: the position which we start the investigation in cartesian coordinate;
	- `directions`: X-Y-Z values of propagation of the spherical or planar wave emitted;
	- `samples_arange`: array with the index of the rf-data;
- **Graph Outputs**:
	- `Image Points`: A Nx4 matrix which represents our points to analyze;

Graph name: `Delay`
####################

This graph is used to compute the transmit delay. It returns an array of values which represent the transmission time for every incremental point of the investigation. *This graph is used in ScanLine and SA applications*.

- **Graph Inputs**:
	- `image_points_from_PL`: the result of Image Points;
	- `image_points_from_PL2`: the result of Image Points;
	- `tx_def_ref_point`: X-Y-Z array with the reference point of the investigation for that iteration;
	- `tx_def_delay_distance`: X-Y-Z array which represent our absolute distance with respect to our focus;
	- `tx_def_delay_distance2`: X-Y-Z array which represent our absolute distance with respect to our focus;
	- `tx_def_focal_point`: X-Y-Z array which represent our focus;
	- `t_start`: The starting time of emission;
- **Graph Outputs**:
	- `delay_to_PL`: A vector which represents our time delay per point to analyze;

Graph name: `Focusing`
#######################
