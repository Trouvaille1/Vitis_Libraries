Vitis Ultrasound Library
==========================

Vitis Ultrasound Library provides different L1/L2/L3 APIs for ultrasound image processing.

This lib created with the purposes of documenting and explaining how to use Ultrasound Beamforming APIs as a Toolbox based on AIE design. The Library contains all the functions and some examples on how to build a custom Beamformer.

Current version provides:

- L1, the lowest level of abstraction and is composed of simple BLAS operation
- L2, the functional units of the Beamformer, which can be obtained by composing L1 libraries
- L3, the example for connected units for 3 beamformer of PW/SA/Scanline
